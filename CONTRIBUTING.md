# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in Resist AI! If you have any ideas for improvement, please open a pull request or just create an issue with your suggestions. I will do my best to review all suggestions and accept those that fit with the spirit of the project.

## Possible areas of improvement

- The most important thing in this project is **action**. If you have suggestion for content for the **How to resist AI** section, please share them.
- Similarly, if you think I need more content in the **Why resist AI** section, you're welcome to share your thoughts. I would like to keep that section snappy though so most of the focus is on action.
- **Design**: I am obviously not very good at web design, so if you have some skills in that area, please do share them.
- **Automation**: I'm planning some basic automation around Markdown linting, conversion to HTML and publishing to the web. If you have any suggestions, please share.

## Be nice
